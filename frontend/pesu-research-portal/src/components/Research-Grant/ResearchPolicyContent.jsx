                PES Universityâ€™s ambitions for research policies and initiatives can be grouped into ten objectives:
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                1. <strong>Special Research Funds:</strong> Special research funds are earmarked by the university to meet the objectives of the Research Policy Plan. The funds are available in two categories: Seed level and Growth level. In addition, competitive external funding plays an important role in meeting the objectives of the research plans of the university. Seed level and Growth level funding should be a good beginning for acquiring external research funds. The university calls for proposals to fund the researchers competently through a transparent process. The researchers have to ensure to complete all research projects in time and achieve the set goals. In case of any anomalies, it has to be brought to the notice of the Dean of Research, who will escalate it to the Vice Chancellor appropriately. The decision of the Vice Chancellor is final and binding upon all involved. The details regarding funds are given in Appendix A.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                2. <strong>Organizational Structure:</strong> The organizational structure is an education-based organizational chart. The duties of the Dean of Research, Research Council, and Academic Council are transparent. In addition, initiatives are taken to strengthen and encourage inter- and multidisciplinary cooperation and to use available infrastructure of various disciplines efficiently. The university will invest in up-to-date research infrastructure on a need basis and will remain a priority. The university pledges to inventorize, organize, and share the available infrastructure efficiently.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                3. <strong>National and International Collaboration:</strong> The research policy plan at PES University will focus on gaining national and international reputation and having collaboration with reputed institutes around the world. The research policy, therefore, aims to back such research ambitions by encouraging and supporting researchers in doing quality research. This will be facilitated by expanding the research curriculum to include study on new evolutions at all levels of education. Also, to facilitate recruitment of highly motivated researchers with international exposure and admitting research students with a good academic background.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                4. <strong>Promoting Research Findings:</strong> The university encourages promoting research findings at appropriate platforms. The allowances to travel for reputed conferences within India and outside India are governed by the travel grants policy specified by the university. The university encourages faculty members to publish or patent the findings in accordance with the university publication policy.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                5. <strong>Obligations to Research Team:</strong> Faculty members must be aware of their obligations to staff and students working as part of the research team. It is particularly important that the domain/center head updates staff, students, postdocs, and visiting scholars in their research group about the research activities, sponsorships, intellectual property rights, and responsibilities of the team members. Faculty members and students also need to ensure that approved research protocols are followed while carrying out research work.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                6. <strong>Research Misconduct:</strong> Research misconduct is a failure to adhere to high standards of professional conduct and integrity and to the principles contained in this policy. All researchers must comply with the relevant laws, guidelines of regulatory agencies, and University research policy. Failure to comply with this policy will be considered to be interpreted as research misconduct. All concerns about the misconduct of research must be reported to the Dean of Research. According to the stipulated protocol of Research misconduct, a preliminary investigation will be carried out by the Dean of Research and a report will be submitted to the Vice Chancellor. If an allegation and instance of misconduct are found apparent, the Vice Chancellor will constitute a committee to further investigate and report. The action to be taken based on the report submitted by the investigating committee lies with the Vice Chancellor. The decision of the Vice Chancellor will be final and binding upon all the members involved.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                7. <strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> The responsible conduct of research requires the disclosure of any real or perceived conflict of interest. Researchers and faculty members must disclose any affiliation or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a direct or indirect interest in the research work or resources used for research work. Researchers have to report any conflict of interest that has the potential to influence research findings, publication, media reports, grant application, commercial products, and finances. Disclosure must be made to the Dean of Research who will refer the matter to the Vice Chancellor for further advice.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                8. <strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> All potentially patentable inventions, created and invented by faculty members of the University using University resources, must be disclosed to the University. If intellectual property rights have to be claimed, ownership of these inventions is assigned to the University regardless of the source of funding. Commercialization of technologies developed using University resources will guarantee the contractual obligations of sponsors. Sharing royalties from such commercialization with the University is part of such contracts and will be in accordance with the IPR policy of the University (Appendix C).

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                9. <strong>External Funding:</strong> A copy of the proposals for external mural funding must be submitted to the office of the Dean of Research. The Principal Investigator has overall responsibility for the technical and fiscal management of a sponsored project. This includes the management of the project within funding limitations, adherence to reporting requirements, and compliance with application regulations. The sharing of University resources for such sponsored projects will be in accordance with the university policy.
